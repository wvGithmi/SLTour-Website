        <p class="detail-para">
            Yala combines a strict nature reserve with a national park. Divided into 5 blocks, the park has a protected area of nearly 
            130,000 hectares of land consisting of light forests, scrubs, grasslands, tanks and lagoons. Two blocks are currently opened 
            to the public.
            Situated in Sri Lanka’s south-east hugging the panoramic Indian Ocean, Yala was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1900 and 
            was designated a national park in 1938. Ironically, the park was initially used as a hunting ground for the elite under British 
            rule. Yala is home to 44 varieties of mammal and 215 bird species. Among its more famous residents are the world’s biggest 
            concentration of leopards, majestic elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, peacocks, and crocodiles. The best 
            time to visit Yala is between February and July when the water levels of the park are quite low, bringing animals into the open.

        <p class="detail-para">
            Located along the north-west coast 26km from Puttalam, famous for its unique lakes called Villus. The park covers 425 sq ft of the 
            coastal area.This is generally a dry zone but still is able to accomadate an impressive number of wildlife. It is also one of the 
            largest and oldest national parks of the country. Since the park is located in a dry zone the average temperature is about 27 degrees. 
            Despite its climate and location the park is covered with very dense shrubbery, a large expanse of grasslands, and an abundant amount 
            of water for a park located in a dry area. The major attractions in the park are the endemic sloth bears, leopards, barking deers and 
            elephants. This is yet another bird-watching paradise where endemic birds are most common such as the jungle fowl 
            ( the ntaional bird of Sri Lanka ). Mammals are not the only attractions here, reptiles, amphibians and insects such as butterflies , 
            the Great Egg Fly and Common Rose just to name a few, also claim popularity among the visitors. Crocodiles and a wide range of snakes 
            also makes Wilpattu National Park their home.

        <a name="Wasgamuwa"><h1 id="heading">Wasgamuwa National Park</h1></a>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Wasgamuwa National Park is one of the many national parks in Sri Lanka. It earned its name as a national park during the Mahaweli 
            Development Project in 1984 in which it provide refuge to countless displaced wild animals. Originally it was supposedly considered 
            as a nature reserve in 1938, and then in the early 1970's the park was regarded as a strict nature reserve. This is one of the 
            places in Sri Lanka where elephants can be seen in very large numbers. It also rises up to prominence for bird-watchers too , 
            and is also considered as one of the Important Bird Areas in Sri Lanka. The name of Wasgamuwa is a derivative of two words Walas 
            Gamuwa where Walasa is the Sinhala word for the Sloth Bear ( who are also present but in very small numbers ) and Gamuwa which 
            means wood. The park is simply just about 225 km away from the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.

        <p class="detail-para">
            Beruwala Beach is also known as ‘Golden Beach' because of its rich golden coloured sand flashing under the sun with the 
            shimmering water tides lapping its shores. It is characterized by far fetching palm trees that covers the sea shores. It is 
            the first beach resort in the South Western region of Sri Lanka, located about 15 kilometres from the south of Kalutara town, 
            55 kilometres from Colombo and 92 kilometres from the International airport at Nigombo. This Golden Mile beach in Beruwala 
            offers a lot of adventure activities like water scooter rides, para sailing, wind surfing, water skiing etc. A 10 minutes boat 
            ride to the International lighthouse, 20 feet above sea level,  at an island called Barberyn will definitely prove to be a 
            worth visiting place as it offers a panoramic view of the sea and the landscape.

        <p class="detail-para">
            A small beach with great surfing, lots of greenery and some fine establishments for eats and hangs. Hiriketiya is one of those 
            sleepy Southern beaches that – after being ‘discovered’ by backpackers – is not so sleepy anymore. Locals can kick themselves 
            for not finding it earlier, but tourism also brings restaurants and hotels and things to do besides swim.

        <p class="detail-para">
            Pasikuda, meaning “green-algae-bay” is situated in Eastern seaboard of Sri Lanka between Kalkuda and the Indian Ocean, approximately 
            35 kilometers from Batticaloa Town. The turquoise blue waters of the bay attracts local and foreign tourist to this wide sandy place 
            under the hot tropical sun to surf, swim or just frolic in the water. Many other activities are available from kite surfing, boogie 
            boarding to surfing and sailing across in a canoe. Long out of reach due to the civil conflict in Sri Lanka, is now re-emerging as a 
            tourist hot spot in the East of Sri Lanka. Coconut palms and palmyrah tree adorn the shores of this area, due to the semi-arid state, 
            Sun screen and a large brimmed hat is recommended along with lots of liquid, to keep the heat under control.

        <p class="detail-para">
            The Dambulla temple has five caves and 157 statues of the Lord Buddha, many paintings on the ceilings and walls that emphasis the 
            artistic talent of ancient days. The history of the caves, rock and temple dates from the 1st century BC. The fascination of these 
            caves is not only the statues but also the many intricate and delicate paintings that cover the ceiling and walls, created with 
            indigenous traditional paints. Because of the history, archaeological and artistic implications, the premises were declared as one 
            of the UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1991. The temple has been in use for over 22 centuries and still holds a sense of benevolence 
            and spirituality. Visitors may climb up steps to the temple and the view from the top of the rock is as inspiring as the temple’s 
            golden interior.

        <p class="detail-para">
            The ruins of Anuradhapura are one of South Asia’s most evocative sights. The sprawling complex contains a rich collection of 
            archaeological and architectural wonders: enormous dagobas (brick stupas), ancient pools and crumbling temples, built during 
            Anuradhapura’s thousand years of rule over Sri Lanka. Today, several of the sites remain in use as holy places and temples; 
            frequent ceremonies give Anuradhapura a vibrancy that’s a sharp contrast to the museum-like ambience at Polonnaruwa.
            Current-day Anuradhapura is a pleasant albeit sprawling city; a small town that feels more like a large village. There's loads 
            of good budget accommodation, easy bike hire and a relaxed pace, making it a good place to spend an extra day.

            If there is one place that draws locals and tourists alike with its colonial charm and richly preserved history, then it has 
            to be the Galle Fort. A trip to Sri Lanka is incomplete without a visit or a stay at this inimitable location. The capital of 
            the Southern Province, this UNESCO world heritage site still emanates the atmospheric charm of the Dutch who built it almost 
            300 years ago. With beautiful beaches like Unawatuna and Mihiripenna not far away, this gem of the coastal belt is an absolute 
            treat no matter how many times you visit. A number of important churches are located within the fort, including the Groote Kerk, 
            the oldest Protestant church in Sri Lanka.

        <p class="detail-para">
            This old steamship wreck takes its name from the nearby Panadura estuary. While the wreck itself is broken up, there are some 
            nice features to explore including two huge anchors, a boiler and parts of the cabins. The wreck rests at 12 meters/39 feet and 
            is suitable for all levels of divers to enjoy. Marine life here is varied and you’ll find healthy numbers of reef fish as well 
            as several larger species including barracuda, groupers, moray eels and sting rays.

        <p class="detail-para">
            The cultivation commenced in the year 1880. Few British planters during that period are namely Sir Thomas Willias (legislator) 
            and Mr. Ellsey Moutsley. The name is derived from an enlightened background of the length of the stream drive across Estate Dhiga 
            Oya (‘Dhiga’ means long and ‘Oya’ means River in Sinhalese) and later it evolved as Dickoya. The History reveals King Nishanka 
            Malla had travelled through this path to Adams Peak in the AC 1500. Dunbar Division was a separate Estate which was later merged 
            with Dickoya Estate when the Factory gutted down in 1920. Then Dickoya Estate maintained two famous Play Grounds namely Dunbar 
            and DMCC Grounds, where the two legends Mahatma Gandhi and Late Sir Bradman had paid visit on their mission.

        <p class="detail-para">
            The point of Lipton’s Seat is reached by climbing for around 7km surrounded by peaceful green tea plantations and an occasional colorful tea plucker. 
            There are two routes available; one from the Nayabedda estate in Bandarawela, and the second through the Dambatenna estate in Haputale. Both routes 
            have entrances marked with sign boards and narrow paved roads. Some parts of the road even have some of the original stone constructions from the 
            British era of Ceylon, and hence are worth seeing from a historical point of view. The climb takes about two and a half hours on average, after a visitor 
            reaches the hill top. From Lipton’s Seat the Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Eastern provinces spread out from before the feet of the viewer in a display 
            rivaling that of the famed World’s End observation point. Visible from the hill top are 7 provinces along with sights such as Handapanagala Lake, Chandrika 
            Lake, Udawalawe Lake, Wedihitikanda Mountains, and even the Hambanthota harbor from the Southern coast.

        <a name="White-tea"><h1 id="heading">Virgin White Tea Plantation</h1></a>

        <p class="detail-para">
            The Handunugoda Tea Estate, perhaps the closest tea plantation in the world to the sea. However, this is not the only thing that makes the Handunugoda 
            Tea Estate special. The estate is known as the Virgin White Tea Factory – it produces a white tea completely untouched by human hands. The process of 
            tea plucking follows an ancient Chinese Ritual where the choicest of teas were cut by virgins who never touched the tea with their bare skin and offered 
            the resulting produce up as a tribute to the Emperor. Handunugoda mimics this tradition, although these days the ‘virgin’ concept only applies to the tea, 
            not the tea pluckers! This white tea is rich in anti-oxidants and is said to be the healthiest tea in the world. Coincidentally it is also one of the most 
            expensive teas in the world fetching at over 1500 USD per kilo. According to the latest testing Virgin White has an anti-oxidant content of 10.11 percent, 
            which is said to be the highest naturally occurring content of anti-oxidants in any beverage. Marriage Freres which is perhaps one of the world’s most 
            exclusive Tea Salons situated at Faubourg Saint Honore in Central Paris offers its exquisite client Handunugoda’s virgin White tea.

        <p class="detail-para">
            Built in 1940, during the British rule, the factory is perched 1,230 meters above sea level in the cool climes of the Uva region, located 200 Kms from Colombo 
            and 6 Kms from Ella, a picturesque little hamlet in the Uva province. The tea factory was acquired by Mr A.P.D Abeyrathne, Chairman of U.H.E Group, in 1970 as 
            a small-scale factory producing only 20,000 kg per month back in the day.
            In 2008 the factory was named the largest tea producer in Sri Lanka’s Uva region. Within just three and a half decades, it has grown rapidly; from humble 
            beginning with a production capacity of 20,000 kg a month, powered by 15 workers and 2 lorries, to the current impressive turnout of 150,000 kg per month with 
            over 40 lorries collecting tea per day with a man power of over 300 workers.
            Located a short distance from the Halpe Temple en route to Badulla is where you will encounter the bustling Uva Halpewatte Tea Factory which is 1,230 meters 
            above sea level. Ideally suited for experiencing the very best that a tea tour in Sri Lanka has to offer, visitors to the factory will be met with a number of 
            activities to do. From meandering through lush, green tea gardens to finally savouring your own ‘cuppa’, one is sure to have plenty to talk of coming to the 
            conclusion of one’s journey.

        <a name="Ella"><h1 id="heading">Ella Rock</h1></a>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Trekkers would love the place. It’s bit tiring to do the hiking. But it is definitely worth it. Once you got to the summit you will realize why we said so. 
            The panoramic views it provides with mist and cloud covering the area, especially in the early mornings and the late evenings are something you should 
            witness and that would suffice enough to say that you visited Ella.
            Total time for climbing up and down is 4 hours. Yes, sounds like a long journey. But the way up there is with full of diversity. If you are starting form 
            Ella train station, you would enjoy the rail walk, and soon as you started climbing up, you will be passing a waterfall, the rubber tree forest and tea 
            plantations.

        <a name="Pidurangala"><h1 id="heading">Pidurangala</h1></a>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Pidurangala is an enormous rock located a few kilometres north of Sigiriya. The two rocks have an interlinked history: whilst King Kasyapa was building 
            Sigiriya Rock Fortress in the 5th century, he moved monks living around Sigiriya to a new monastery on Pidurangala Rock. An ancient cave temple still 
            houses objects from various vintages that reflect Buddhist, Hindu and western beliefs, and the stupa to the left of the temple entrance is believed to 
            mark the spot where King Kasyapa was cremated. Pidurangala is a more challenging climb than Sigiriya, so should not be attempted by those with poor 
            physical fitness. There is no clear path to the top: steep, uneven steps give way to an expanse of boulders and crevices that climbers must navigate in 
            order to reach the summit. From the top, there are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock.

        <a name="Adam"><h1 id="heading">Adam's Peak</h1></a>

        <p class="detail-para">
            The amazing Adam’s Peak is Sri Lanka’s fourth highest mountain at 2244m and is located 40km northeast of Ratnapura. Adam’s Peak or the Sri Pada is an important 
            pilgrim site. Buddhist believe the impression on the summit is the footprint of lord Buddha himself. Though it takes around 5 hours to reach the peak by foot, 
            devotees of many religions climb the mountain daily to invoke blessings. The mountain is also named as Samanala Kanda or Butterfly Mountain.
            The pilgrims season to Sri Pada traditionally starts on the full moon of December and ends on the full moon of April. During the first half of the season the 
            night ascent isn’t crowded. However during the latter half of the season, more people attempt the climb with each passing day.

        <p class="detail-para">
            The Horton Plains plateau comes to a sudden end at World’s End, a stunning escarpment that plunges 880m. The walk here is 4km, but the trail then loops back to Baker’s 
            Falls (2km) and continues back to the entrance (another 3.5km). The 9.5km round trip takes a leisurely three hours. Unless you get there early, the view from World’s 
            End is often obscured by mist, particularly during the rainy season from April to September. All you can expect to see from World’s End after around 9am is a swirling 
            white wall. The early morning (between 6am and 10am) is the best time to visit, before the clouds roll in. That’s when you’ll spy toy-town, tea-plantation villages in 
            the valley below, and an unencumbered view south towards the coast.

        <p class="detail-para">
            The scenic and serene village of Kitulgala is situated west of Sri Lanka, 95 km from Colombo on the Colombo-Avissawella- Hatton Road in the Sabaragamuwa Province. From 
            Colombo, Kitulgala can be reached via the Colombo-Avissawela- Ruwanwella route. Kitulgala is where the famous film “The Bridge over the River Kwai” the World War II epic 
            film directed by David Lean was filmed. Being situated in the wet zone Kitulgala receives rainfall from two monsoons every year, giving the region its lush green vegetation, 
            verdant mountains and the impressive Kelani River’s cascading waters.
            he Kitulgala Forest Reserve (Makandawa Forest Reserve) covering 1,155 ha was established with the objective of protecting the catchment of the Kelani River. It is a secondary 
            lowland rainforest gradually moving towards higher elevations and is accessible by crossing the Kelani River by boat (usually a traditional dugout canoe with an outrigger) 
            and it is sometimes possible to wade across during the dry seasons.

        <p class="detail-para">
            Sinharaja Forest Reserve meaning ‘Lion Kingdom’ is the best known Rain Forest in the country and has been identified as important biodiversity hotspot. The Park was originally 
            declared a forest reserve in 1875 and due to its international importance it was designated as a Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1988.
            It is situated 172.1 km from Colombo via the Southern Expressway and is accessible from any of its three entrances; Pitadeniya, Kudawa and Morning Side. The vegetation at Sinharaja 
            is that of a tropical wet evergreen forest with large trees that grow to heights of 35m to 40m and even going up to 50m, believed to have unbelievable genetic potential, waiting 
            to be tapped. Some families of Dipterocarpaceae show an endemism of over 90%, of the 211 woody trees and lianas, 66% or 139 of them are endemic to the forest reserve. The lower 
            plants such as Ferns and epiphytes of the 25 endemic species 13 have been recorded within Sinharaja itself.

            masks carvings and masks dancing. The present institution named ‘Ariyapala & Sons’ passing through their fifth generation of traditional masks carving and dancing is a very popular 
            cultural center in Ambalangoda. It was named after “Ariyapala Wijesuriya Gurunnanse”, one of the greatest master craftsmen in Sri Lanka.

        <a name="Beeralu"><h1 id="heading">Beeralu Lace Making in Tamarind Hill</h1></a>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Beeralu lace weaving is an age-old Sri Lankan tradition that is now on the verge of being forgotten. Though this form of art is still alive in many villages on the southern coast of 
            the country, it is an arduous process that takes skill, time and effort to bring to fruition.
            Beeralu lace weaving, also known as bobbin lace making, is a lengthy practice. A weaver first needs to hand-draw the pattern of the lace on graph paper, after which the pattern is 
            marked with pins, and wrapped around a lace pillow. Then, several lengths of thread are woven or braided with the help of wooden bobbins to create a finished piece of lace. Though 
            this process takes up much more effort when compared to machine-cut lace products that can be produced in bulk and on demand, the authenticity and quality of Beeralu lace is 
            unparalleled.

            caution as the elephants found at Bundala is a little more aggressive due to human-elephant conflict in the area. Area is home to many plant species along with mammals, reptiles and

            Located in the southeast corner of Sri Lanka , the 18,149 hectare KUMANA (YALA EAST) NATIONAL PARK is a well-known eco tourism attraction and bird sanctuary where a multitude of birds 
            breed and roost. One of the most significant features of the park is the 'Kumana Villu' - a 200 hectare natural swamp lake, fed by the 'Kumbukkan Oya' through a half mile long narrow 
            channel. It is at this mangrove swamp that many water birds nest in May and June. Regular sightings include such species of bird as pelicans, painted storks, spoonbills, white ibis, 
            herons, egrets and little cormorants.
            The very rare black-necked stork has also been spotted at the swamp. Besides the prolific birdlife, Kumana is also home to some of the mammals found in the larger YALA NATIONAL PARK 
            (west) park, such as elephants and leopards. The vegetation in Kumana consists mainly of mangrove trees, kumbuk trees and the karan fern, as well as the open marsh area. For bird watching 
            enthusiasts, the park is an 'absolute must'.

        <p class="detail-para">
            Arugam Bay Beach, one of the top ten surf beaches of the world, is situated in the South-east coast of Sri Lanka. Arugam Bay 
            Beach was the venue for ISA (International Surfing Association) surfing competition in the summer of 2004. Situated in close 
            proximity to Lahugala National Park, famous for its herds of elephants and Pottuvil Lagoon, a Bird Sanctuary, Arugam Bay provides 
            ample opportunities for wildlife excursions. The road south of Arugam Bay leads down the coastal villages of Panama and then 
            on to Okanda, the gateway to Yala East National Park, the eastern section of famous Ruhuna Yala National Park. Surfing at the 
            peak season at Arugam Bay Beach The peak season along this eastern coastline runs from March to October, the off season of 
            western and southern coasts of Sri Lanka. The long, consistent right hand point break at the southern end of the Arugam Bay 
            beach makes it the finest surf spot in Sri Lanka. Dolphin viewing at Arugam Bay Beach During the period of May to September 
            within the high season of Arugam Bay beach, Dolphin viewing is popular with two-hour boat trips into the sea.
        </p>

        <h2>Surfing in Arugam Bay</h2>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Arugam bay is on the list of the top ten surf points in the world. Situated on the South East side of Sri Lanka Arugam bay 
            receives the same Antarctic winter swell’s that hit Indonesia in the in the middle of the year. The best time of the year is 
            between May and November when the predominant wind is offshore for at least the first half of the day. Due to its location 
            and southerly swell direction the area is dominated by right hand point breaks. There is a beach break in front of the 
            Stardust Hotel, which can be fun for body surfing or for beginners but that’s about it. Three of the point breaks “The Point”, 
            “Pottuvil Point” and “Crocodile Rock” are within a hour tuk tuk ride from the Hotel, with “The Point being visible (15 min walk) 
            from the hotel. There are several other points that are within a 1-hour’s ride or can be accessed by boat. Some of the staff at 
            the hotel surf and are only to happy to help you plan surf trips to some of these lesser known breaks.

        <p class="detail-para">
            Kandy, the cultural capital of Sri Lanka, a World Heritage Site sits pretty in a valley surrounded by rings of mountains, 115km away 
            from the seaport of Colombo. Right in the heart of the city center of Kandy is the man-made lake called Kiri Muhuda (Sinhala: the sea of milk), 
            the one and only decorative lake in Sri Lanka. All other thousands of man-made reservoirs in Sri Lanka are developed primarily for the 
            purposes of irrigation, and secondarily for the purposes of general use and wildlife conservation. Kandy is the transportation hub of 
            the Central province; it is also the gateway to the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka. The Good Shed bus station and railway station have 
            huddled up to each other at the southwest corner of the city center. Kandy affords ample accommodation options ranging from international 
            standing 5 star hotels to budget guest houses in the city center, in and around Kandy and the suburbs of Kandy.

        <h2>Kandy Esala Perahara</h2>

        <p class="detail-para">
            The Esala Perahera in Kandy is one of the oldest and grandest of all Buddhist festivals in Sri Lanka, featuring dancers, jugglers, 
            musicians, fire-breathers, and lavishly decorated elephants. This is held in Esala (July or August) which is the month that is believed 
            to commemorate the first teaching given by the Buddha after he attained enlightenment. The Kandy Esala Perahera lasts for ten days while 
            various festivities can be witnessed right throughout. The Sinhalese term ‘Perahera’ means a parade of musicians, dancers, singers, acrobats 
            and various other performers accompanied by a large number of caparisoned Tuskers and Elephants parading the streets in celebration of a 
            religious event.<br>The Esala Perahera in Kandy is celebrated to honour the Sacred Tooth Relic and the four ‘guardian’ Gods Natha, Vishnu, 
            Kataragama and Goddess Pattini. The Kandy Maligawa Perahera is followed in order by those of the Natha, Vishnu, Kataragama and Pattini 
            ‘Devales’ (Temples dedicated to these Gods) which are situated in the vicinity of the Kandy Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth).

        <a name="Sigiriya"><h1 id="heading">Ancient City of Sigiriya</h1></a>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Rising dramatically from the central plains, the enigmatic rocky outcrop of Sigiriya is perhaps Sri Lanka's single most dramatic 
            sight. Near-vertical walls soar to a flat-topped summit that contains the ruins of an ancient civilisation, thought to be once 
            the epicentre of the short-lived kingdom of Kassapa, and there are spellbinding vistas across mist-wrapped forests in the early 
            morning. Sigiriya refuses to reveal its secrets easily, and you'll have to climb a series of vertiginous staircases attached to 
            sheer walls to reach the top. On the way you'll pass a series of quite remarkable frescoes and a pair of colossal lion's paws 
            carved into the bedrock. The surrounding landscape – lily-pad-covered moats, water gardens and cave shrines – only add to 
            Sigiriya's rock-star appeal.
        </p>

        <h2>Sigiriya Sanctuary Bird Watching</h2>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Sigiriya rock has a designated forest reserve and its very good destination to watch birds. King Kashyapa built his rock fortress 
            in the 5th century so as to have a bird’s eye view of approaching enemies. Today, from its summit it is birds and wildlife the 
            intrepid visitor sees .Sigiriya sanctuary is a well-protected UNESCO World heritage site. This is a heavenly place for birds with 
            thick canopies and forests.Sigiriya is surrounded with vast manmade tanks and this has made it to become a place to witness large 
            number of migratory and endemic birds.

        <h2>Hikkaduwa Scuba Diving</h2>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Between 30 minutes and an hour from the coast, offshore of Hikkaduwa you will come across a fine stretch of Scuba Diving 
            sites which consist of wrecks, corals, caves, rocks and plenty of marine life. Hikkaduwa is a fine base to enjoy Scuba 
            Diving since the diving sites extend from the north to the south of Hikkaduwa.
        </p>

        <h2>Hikkaduwa Surfing</h2>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Hikkaduwe located on the south western coast is one of the the best locations for surfing. Hikkaduwa is more crowded while 
            arugambay is completely the opposite, but lacks the development of Hikkaduwe. Hikkaduwe boasts of about four places you 
            could surf and during season you could ride the waves 2 – 6 feet in height both ways, so the experts say. All above places 
            have deep water and flat reef’s, making them ideal for surfing, but not for the novice.

        <h2>Kalpitiya Bar Reef</h2>

        <a name="Trincomalee"><h1 id="heading">Trincomalee Scuba Diving, Dolphin & Whale Watching</h1></a>

        <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Trincomalee, the largest natural harbor in Sri Lanka features numerous wrecks. The star attraction is the aircraft carrier 
            Hermes. The British aircraft carrier HMS Hermes, which was sunk off the east coast by the Japanese Air force in 1942 during 
            the World War, now sits upside down, 53 meters deep, with decks and superstructure within the 30-40 meter range. HMS Hermes 
            is recommended for divers with minimum technical training to 50 meters.
        </p>

        <h2>Dolphin & Whale Watching</h2>

        <p class="detail-para">
            Trincomalee has quickly evolving into an important dolphin and whale watching destination for two reasons; the frequent sightings 
            of Humpback whales, Blue whales and the discovery of several super pods of Sperm whales consisting of 50 members or more that 
            reside in these waters during the peak whale watching window of March – May. Sporadic and random sightings continue during the
            year until September. Another important aspect of Trincomalee is that Whale sightings are also made relatively closer to shore 
            compared to Sri Lanka’s other Whale watching destinations given the deep sea canyon of Trincomalee bay. Research has shown this 
            to be a multiple submarine canyon complex which makes the Trincomalee bay and its adjacent waters ideal for sightings. Sightings 
            can commence as close as 6-8 miles east off the coast of Trincomalee which is approximately a 30 minutes boat ride. Dolphins, the 
            main being the Spinner dolphins are also seen playing, dancing and showing off their acrobatic skills. Other dolphins that can be 
            seen are Bottlenose Dolphins and Fraser’s Dolphins. Most sightings of the dolphin occur between March/April and August/September.
